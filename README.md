# ltypekit

Advanced type checking library for Lua and MoonScript.

---

`ltypekit` is a library born from the purpose of making typechecking easier. Sometimes you'll need several lines of:

```coffeescript
if (type a) == "string" then ...
if (type b) == "number" then ...
```

or even need more complex checks to see if you're getting passed the structure you need. `ltypekit` aims to solve this using the well-known concept of signatures, that certainly works better in statically typed languages like Haskell, but it does the job here. It is combined with a `typeof` function that extends the capability of [typical](https://github.com/hoelzro/lua-typical) or [mtype](https://github.com/jirutka/mtype). These `type` functions check for a `__type` metamethod and pass it back. `typeof`, however, works using the concept of *resolvers*. These are functions which check for specific conditions and return a certain value if it matches the type or not. This means you can add your own types and resolvers, and use libraries such as [tableshape](https://github.com/leafo/tableshape) so that you can use the full capability of this function. Signatures, in its current state, support nesting functions, unknowns, type variables and constraints, among others.

## Installing

You can install it via LuaRocks:

```
$ luarocks install ltypekit
```

Or, alternatively, you can install it for your project, unmanaged:

```
$ cp ./ltypekit/* ./lib/ltypekit/
```

## Importing

You can import it in your code as such:

```python
import sign   from require "ltypekit"
import typeof from require "ltypekit.type"
```

Or, in Lua:

```lua
local ltypekit = require "ltypekit"
ltypekit.type  = require "ltypekit.type"
local sign     = ltypekit.sign
local typeof   = ltypekit.type.typeof
```

## Usage

### typeof (ltypekit.type)

#### Resolvers

Resolvers are functions which take in any value and return something depending on whether it can resolve the type or not. Resolvers such as `has_meta` will return the string of the type. Others, such as IO, return a boolean value, since the type is guessed from the resolver function's name.

##### Issues with overlapping

You should make sure that your resolver *only* resolves your type, so that not all tables, for example, are marked as a "Collection" type. If your type is too simple to be easily confused (say, a bidimensional vector), you should consider creating a `__type` metamethod which gives the 2DVector value.

#### `typeof\add name, resolver`
Adds a raw type to typeof.

#### `typeof\new T`

Adds a type from a T object (template or type holder).

#### `typeof\resolve val, resolverl`

Returns the type for `val`, using the resolvers in `resolverl`. You will rarely have to use this function.

#### `typeof\resolves val`

Checks if `typeof` can resolve `a`, it will return `true` and the name of the type, otherwise just `false`. Bear in mind, this doesn't fallback to the native `type` method.

#### `typeof val`

Equivalent to `typeof\resolve`, but it wraps the `resolverl` so that you don't have to provide it.

### typeE (ltypekit.type)

Creates a type template, you can optionally pass to it a name (defaults to "?") and an annotation. These combined should form something like `Char str`

### data (ltypekit.type)

Creates a new, single type with several constructors using a simple resolver. It takes a type template `T` (or any table) and a definition table. It will also automatically test itself in case the constructor does not generate a valid type.

```lua
data Char
  name:         "Char"
  annotation:   "Char string"
  resolver:     (v) -> ((type v)=="string") and (#v==1)
  constructor:  (v) -> v\sub 1,1
  constructors: {Char}
```

### metatype (ltypekit.type)

Creates a constructor for any type (using `__type`)

```lua
Container = typeE "Container", "number string"
metatype Container, (n, s) -> {id: n, name: s}
typeof Container 5, "name" -- Container
```

### typeforall (ltypekit.type)

Checks that all the values in a list are of the same type. If so, it returns the type name, otherwise returns false.

### typeforany (ltypekit.type)

Returns all the possible types in a list.

### sign (ltypekit.init / ltypekit.sign)

Perhaps the most useful function of the whole library. It takes in a signature, and returns a `signed_constructor` value. This value has overloaded `+` and `-` metamethods, but these should be deprecated soon. You can make a function safe if you change `<constructor>.safe` to `true`, and so it will error in warnings. Contrary to that, you can change `<constructor>.silent` to `false` if you don't want any warnings to appear. `false` is default for `.safe` and `true` is default for `.silent`. Once you got that, you only have to pass a function to your constructor, and a `signed` value function will be created, which will work just as you would expect.

## Signatures

Signatures are currently different from those you'd see in Haskell (but I'm working to change that!). The basic functioning is:

```
string -> (a -> *) -> [c|b] -> a -> d<string> -> e<x|y>
^          ^  ^ ^     ^        ^    ^            ^
|          |  | |     |        |    |            Constraints
|          |  | |     |        |   A type cons-  can have
|          |  | |     |        |   traint        unions!
|          |  | |     |       a will be the same
|          |  | |     |       type across all the
|          |  | |     |       signature!
|          |  | |     Unions!
|          |  | * accepts any type and
|          |  | ! accepts all but nil
|          |  |
|          |  This does work! You can have functions
|          |  in the signature and they will, indeed
|          |  ask for a signed function.
|          |
|        Type variables!
Use type names to ask for those types.
```

## Other types

There is an extensive collection of types in the works. You can check out a small preview in the `ltypekit/types/` folder.
